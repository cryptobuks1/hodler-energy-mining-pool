The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. Of course, all of these requirements are satisfied by the Laravel Homestead virtual machine, so it's highly recommended that you use Homestead as your local Laravel development environment.

However, if you are not using Homestead, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

    PHP >= 7.1.3
    OpenSSL PHP Extension
    PDO PHP Extension
    Mbstring PHP Extension
    Tokenizer PHP Extension
    XML PHP Extension
    Ctype PHP Extension
    JSON PHP Extension
    BCMath PHP Extension

    composer install

    npm install

    php artisan key:generate

Now Need some Laravel Commands

    php artisan serve
    Serves your project

    npm run watch
    Watches your files and compiles your assets on the fly (also auto reloads your browser)
